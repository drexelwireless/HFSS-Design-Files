This is a low-cost, beam-steerable 4 × 10 antenna array system operating at 60 GHz. 
The proposed antenna system is fed by a 4 × 10 Butler Matrix network designed using microstrip line (ML) structure. 
Chebyshev tapered microstrip antenna arrays with 10 series-fed elements are connected to four output ports of the feed network. 
Four steerable beams with maximum 16.5 dBi system gain and 1GHz bandwidth(BW) satisfy the requirements of millimeter wave propagation study and handset application for 5G communication.
