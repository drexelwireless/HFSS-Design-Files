In this paper we propose a pattern reconfigurable planar antenna with integrated control circuitry, for flexible applications with Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms. 
The antenna's layout is made by four folded microstrip elements placed symmetrically on a low cost FR-4 substrate. 
By using PIN diodes, the metallic elements can be switched to generate a single omnidirectional beam or six directional beams around the azimuth plane. 
The design includes MOSFET based control circuitry for switching the PIN diodes. 
The RF performance has been experimentally evaluated under different levels of control voltage. 
The radiation of omnidirectional and directional beams along with an integrated control board, allows for convenient utilization of the antenna in numerous SDR MIMO platforms.

Modern 802.11 ac wireless systems are capable of dual-band operations in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands to enhance bandwidth and data throughput. 
These systems typically employ separated radiators for the two bands, increasing cost and space requirements. 
In this work, we describe two approaches that can be used to design a single planar antenna which can resonate at 2.4 and 5 GHz, as well as generate omnidirectional and directional radiation patterns. 
In the first approach, we used a single set of dual-band elements, where the two bands are separated through lumped inductors and capacitors. 
In the second approach, we designed two independent sets of elements for each band, connected to the central RF port by lumped diplexers. 
We discuss the designs and the measured results for these two approaches, highlighting the advantages and limitations of the respective radiation characteristics.
