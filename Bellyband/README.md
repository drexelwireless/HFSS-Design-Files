Recent advancements in conductive yarns and fabrication technologies offer exciting opportunities to design and knit seamless garments equipped with sensors for biomedical applications. 
In this work, we discuss the design and application of a wearable strain sensor, which can be used for biomedical monitoring such as contraction, respiration, or limb movements. 
The system takes advantage of the intensity variations of the backscattered power (RSSI) from an inductively-coupled RFID tag under physical stretching. 
First, we describe the antenna design along with the modeling of the sheet impedance, which characterizes the conductive textile. 
Experimental results with custom fabricated prototypes showed good agreement with the numerical simulation of input impedance and radiation pattern. 
Finally, the wearable sensor has been applied for infant breathing monitoring using a medical programmable mannequin. 
A machine learning technique has been developed and applied to post-process the RSSI data, and the results show that breathing and non-breathing patterns can be successfully classified.

Flexible antennas have the potential to transform wearable and fabric-based wireless sensing technologies. 
The antenna discussed in this paper is part of a sensing system that uses the back-scattered power level as the decision metric. 
For a good wireless sensor, it is necessary to offer a feasible read-range and maintain good distinctions in the back-scattered power levels between the different states (i.e., level of stretch) of the antenna. 
Moreover, effects due to human body-proximity should be minimized. 
For these reasons, the radiation efficiency is a crucial parameter to investigate. 
This paper presents the radiation efficiency measurement of our flexible knitted "Bellyband" antenna at two different levels of stretch in a reverberation chamber.
This work validates the reverberation chamber measurements through comparison with simulations and anechoic chamber measurements at 900MHz. 
Moreover, this work demonstrates how the approach can be used to quantify bellyband antenna efficiency in the vicinity of a human body. 
Finally, the efficiency results were used to predict the read-range of Bellyband RFID technology.

Researchers are looking for new methods to integrate sensing capabilities into textiles while maintaining the durability, flexibility, and comfort of the garment. 
One method for imparting sensing capabilities into garments is through coupling conductive yarns with the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. 
These smart devices have exhibited promising results for short-term use. 
However, long-term studies of their performance are still needed to evaluate their performance over a longer period. 
Like all garments, wearable sensors are susceptible to environmental factors during use. 
These factors can lead to dielectric coupling and corrosion of conductive yarns, which has the potential to degrade the performance of the device. 
This work analyzes the effect of sweat and moisture on silver-coated nylon yarn by extracting the sheet resistance at 913 MHz from transmission line measurements.
HFSS simulation shows the level of perturbation in antenna performance as sheet resistance increased with each cycle of sweat-immersion, washing, and drying.
