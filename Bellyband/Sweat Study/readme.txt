1. Run Sweat_study.aedt in Ansys Electronic Desktop (HFSS).
2. '2R_FG_wave_port' simulates the transmission line. S21, 
radiation efficiency of structure at 900 MHz are taken from this
simulation.
3. 'sweat_bellyband' simulates a bellyband antenna with new
sheet resistance values. Antenna radiation efficiency results are
taken from here.
