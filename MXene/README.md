Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth-generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio-frequency (RF) devices so far. 
Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low-energy attenuation and patch antennas with high-power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4 GHz. 
The radiation efficiency of a 5.5 µm thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray-coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4 GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35 µm thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. 
MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. 
Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28 GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. 
The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.
